# Day 2: Number Guessing Game

## What I Built
A game where the computer picks a random number and you guess it.


## What I Learned
While loops repeat until a condition is met

Indentation tells Python what belongs together

Where you put your code changes when it runs

Random numbers need import random

## Problems I Fixed
Forgot import random → code crashed

Elif was indented wrong → hints didn't show

Attempt counter only showed 1 → moved it inside while loop
