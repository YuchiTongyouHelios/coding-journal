# Week 1: Python Basics to Number Guesser

## What I Built
- **Day 1:** Personal info bot (input/output, variables)
- **Day 2:** Age calculator with play again loop
- **Day 3:** First number guesser (random numbers)
- **Day 4:** Added difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- **Day 5:** Score tracking (wins, attempts)
- **Day 6:** High score with date
- **Day 7:** Permanent file storage (high score saves)

## What I Learned
- Variables store data
- `if/elif/else` controls program flow
- `while` loops repeat code
- `random` generates numbers
- `datetime` tracks dates
- File saving with `open()` and `with`
- Error handling with `try/except`

## One Thing I Struggled With
- Indentation errors (fixed them)
- Forgetting `.lower()` vs `.lower`
- File permission errors (switched to local Python)

## One Thing I'm Still Fuzzy On
- file saving

## Next Week's Goal
- Build a to-do list app with file saving
