# My Coding Journey

I'm a 14-year-old learning to code, one week at a time. This repository documents my progress, projects, and the things I learn along the way.

## Weekly Logs

| Week | Project | Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Week 1](week1.md) | **Number Guesser** | A command-line game with difficulty levels, persistent high scores, and file storage. |

## About This Journey

I started coding seriously in February 2026. The goal is consistent progress, not perfection. Each week, I build one project and document everything I learn.

**Key principles I follow:**
*   Code every day.
*   Build projects, not just follow tutorials.
*   Document struggles and breakthroughs.
*   Upload progress to GitHub weekly.
